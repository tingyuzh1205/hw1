Nothing needs special attention to my code.
For my getValLoc method, when input 0 it gets the first element

I add a method called print list that will print items and string
in format where / indicates break between items and x means empty string 
example: 

x x x x x x x x x 8 /7 x x x x x x x x x /
this means we have two item and 2 strings in this list
